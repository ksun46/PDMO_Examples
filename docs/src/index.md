# PDMO.jl - **Primal-Dual Methods for Optimization**

## Overview
`PDMO.jl` is a powerful Julia framework for primal-dual multiblock optimization, built for **rapid prototyping** and **high-performance computing**.

- **Solve Complex Problems**: Model and solve problems with multiple variable blocks and linear coupling constriants. 
- **Highly Customizable**: An open-source toolkit that is easy to adapt for your applications and specific algorithms.
- **Accelerate Research**: Benchmark your methods against classic and
state-of-the-art solvers.

### Problem Formulation
`PDMO.jl` presents a unified framework for formulating and solving a ```MultiblockProblem``` of the form: 

```math 
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\mathbf{x}} \quad & \sum_{j=1}^n \left( f_j(x_j) + g_j(x_j) \right)\\ 
\mathrm{s.t.} \quad  & \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b},
\end{aligned}
```
where we have the following problem variables and data:

| **$n$ Block Variables** | **$m$ Block Constraints** | **Block Matrix of $m\times n$ Linear Operators** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| $\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix}$ | $\mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_m \end{bmatrix}$ | $\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{A}_{1,1} & \mathbf{A}_{1,2} & \cdots & \mathbf{A}_{1,n} \\ \mathbf{A}_{2,1} & \mathbf{A}_{2,2} & \cdots & \mathbf{A}_{2,n} \\ \vdots & \vdots &  & \vdots \\ \mathbf{A}_{m,1} & \mathbf{A}_{m,2} & \cdots & \mathbf{A}_{m,n} \end{bmatrix}$ |

More specifically, 
- For each $j\in \{1,\cdots,n\}$, a `BlockVariable` $x_j$ represents a numeric array (i.e., scalar, vector, matrix, etc.), and is associated with two objective functions: 
    - each $f_j$ is differentiable, and $f_j(\cdot)$ and $\nabla f_j(\cdot)$ are available; 
    - each $g_j$ is proximable, and $g_j(\cdot)$ and $\text{prox}_{\gamma g_j}(\cdot)$ are available.
- For each $i \in \{1,\cdots,m\}$, a `BlockConstraint` is defined by $\mathbf{A}_{i,1},\cdots, \mathbf{A}_{i,n}$, and $b_i$: 
    - the linear operator $\mathbf{A}_{i,j}$ is **non-zero** if and only if constraint $i$ involves blocks $x_j$;
    - the right-hand side $b_i$ can be a numeric array of any shape. 


### Algorithms

`PDMO.jl` provides various algorithms to solve problems of the above form.

- **Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)**
  - Graph-based bipartization methods automatically generate ADMM-ready reformulations of `MultiblockProblem`.
  - Various ADMM variants are available: 
    - Original ADMM 
    - Doubly linearized ADMM 
    - Adaptive linearized ADMM 
  - Various algorithmic component can be selected: 
    - Penalty adapters, e.g., Residual Balancing, Spectral Radius Approximation
    - Accelerators, e.g., Halpern (with or without restart), Filtered Anderson

- **Adaptive Primal-Dual Method (AdaPDM)**
  - A suite of efficient and adaptive methods for problems with simpler coupling, i.e., $m=1$, $f_n = 0$, and $\mathbf{A}_{1, n} = -\mathrm{Id}$. 
  ```math 
    \begin{aligned}
    \min_{\mathbf{x}} \quad & \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \left( f_j(x_j) + g_j(x_j) \right) + g_n(\mathbf{A}_{1,1}x_1 + \cdots + \mathbf{A}_{1,n-1}x_{n-1})
    \end{aligned}
  ```
  - Various methods can be selected: 
    - Original Condat-Vu
