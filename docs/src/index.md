# PDMO.jl - **Primal-Dual Methods for Optimization**

## Overview
`PDMO.jl` is a powerful Julia framework for primal-dual multiblock optimization, built for **rapid prototyping** and **high-performance computing**.

- **Solve Complex Problems**: Model and solve problems with multiple variable blocks and linear coupling constriants. 
- **Highly Customizable**: An open-source toolkit that is easy to adapt for your applications and specific algorithms.
- **Accelerate Research**: Benchmark your methods against classic and
state-of-the-art solvers.

### Problem Formulation
`PDMO.jl` presents a unified framework for formulating and solving a ```MultiblockProblem``` of the form: 

```math 
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\mathbf{x}} \quad & F(\mathbf{x}) + \sum_{j=1}^n \left( f_j(x_j) + g_j(x_j) \right)\\ 
\mathrm{s.t.} \quad  & \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b},
\end{aligned}
```
where we have the following problem variables and data:

```math
\begin{array}{ccc}
n~\textbf{Block Variables} \quad & m~\textbf{ Block Constraints} \quad & \textbf{Block Matrix}~ (m \times n ~ \textbf{linear operators}) \\
\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix} \quad & \mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_m \end{bmatrix} \quad & \mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{A}_{1,1} & \mathbf{A}_{1,2} & \cdots & \mathbf{A}_{1,n} \\ \mathbf{A}_{2,1} & \mathbf{A}_{2,2} & \cdots & \mathbf{A}_{2,n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \mathbf{A}_{m,1} & \mathbf{A}_{m,2} & \cdots & \mathbf{A}_{m,n} \end{bmatrix} \\
\end{array}
```

More specifically, 
- For each $j\in \{1,\cdots,n\}$, a `BlockVariable` $x_j$ represents a numeric array (i.e., scalar, vector, matrix, etc.), and is associated with two objective functions: 
    - each $f_j$ is differentiable, and $f_j(\cdot)$ and $\nabla f_j(\cdot)$ are available; 
    - each $g_j$ is proximable, and $g_j(\cdot)$ and $\text{prox}_{\gamma g_j}(\cdot)$ are available.
- For each $i \in \{1,\cdots,m\}$, a `BlockConstraint` is defined by some linear operators and a right-hand side array: 
    - the linear operator $\mathbf{A}_{i,j}$ is **non-zero** if and only if constraint $i$ involves blocks $x_j$;
    - the adjoint operator of $\mathbf{A}_{i,j}$ is available;
    - the right-hand side $b_i$ can be a numeric array of any shape. 
- Additionally, there might exist a smooth function $F$ that couples all BlockVariables:
    - we assume that $F(\cdot)$, $\nabla F(\cdot)$,  and $\nabla_j F(\cdot)$'s for $j\in \{1,\cdots, n\}$ are available.

### Algorithms
