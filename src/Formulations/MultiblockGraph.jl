    MultiblockGraph

A module for representing and analyzing the structure of multi-block optimization problems as graphs.

This module provides data structures and algorithms to:
1. Create a graph representation from a `MultiblockProblem`
2. Analyze graph properties such as bipartiteness and connectivity
3. Identify relationships between variable blocks and constraints

The graph representation uses:
- Nodes: Represent either variable blocks or constraints
- Edges: Represent relationships between nodes (either two-block or multi-block)

This representation is particularly useful for algorithm selection and problem decomposition
in distributed optimization algorithms like ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers).

Node types are used to distinguish between variable blocks and constraints in the graph representation.
Variable nodes correspond to optimization variables, while constraint nodes represent constraints that
involve more than two blocks.

    MultiblockGraph(mbp::MultiblockProblem) -> MultiblockGraph

Constructs a graph representation from a MultiblockProblem.

# Arguments
- `mbp::MultiblockProblem`: The multi-block problem to convert to a graph

# Returns
- A new MultiblockGraph representing the problem structure with bipartiteness and connectivity analyzed

# Algorithm
The construction process follows these steps:
1. **Create variable nodes**: One node for each block variable in the problem
2. **Create constraint nodes**: One node for each constraint involving more than 2 blocks
3. **Create edges**: 
   - TWO_BLOCK_EDGE: Direct edge between two variable nodes (for 2-block constraints)
   - MULTIBLOCK_EDGE: Edge from variable node to constraint node (for >2-block constraints)
4. **Update node neighbors**: Each node maintains a list of connected edge IDs
5. **Analyze properties**: Automatically determines if the graph is bipartite and connected

# Graph Representation Rules
- **2-block constraint**: `A₁x₁ + A₂x₂ = b` → Direct edge between variable nodes
- **Multi-block constraint**: `A₁x₁ + A₂x₂ + A₃x₃ = b` → Constraint node with edges to each variable node

# Example
```julia
mbp = MultiblockProblem()
addBlockVariable!(mbp, BlockVariable("x1", f1, g1, x1_init))
