    Block Selection Rules for BCD Algorithm

Block Coordinate Descent algorithms can use different strategies for selecting 
which block to update at each iteration.

The `updateBlockOrder!` function is called at the beginning of each iteration to 
determine which blocks will be updated and in what order. In the first iteration, 
this API also handles initialization of the block selection strategy.

    CyclicRule <: AbstractBlockUpdateOrder

Cyclic block selection rule that updates blocks in sequential order 1, 2, ..., n.

This rule implements a deterministic block selection strategy where blocks are 
updated in a fixed cyclic pattern. The order is established during the first 
iteration and remains constant throughout the algorithm execution.

# Fields
- `blocksToUpdate::Vector{Int}`: Vector storing the order of blocks to update

# Constructors
- `CyclicRule()`: Creates a new cyclic rule with empty block order (initialized on first use)

# Example
```julia
rule = CyclicRule()
# Block order will be initialized as [1, 2, 3, ..., n] on first updateBlockOrder! call
```

    updateBlockOrder!(rule::CyclicRule, mbp::MultiblockProblem, info::BCDIterationInfo)

Update the block selection order for the cyclic rule strategy.

This function is called at the beginning of each BCD iteration to determine which 
blocks will be updated and in what order. For the cyclic rule, blocks are updated 
in sequential order from 1 to n.

# Arguments
- `rule::CyclicRule`: The cyclic block selection rule to update
- `mbp::MultiblockProblem`: The multiblock problem containing the blocks
- `info::BCDIterationInfo`: Information about the current BCD iteration

# Behavior
- On first call (when `rule.blocksToUpdate` is empty), initializes the block order 
  as [1, 2, ..., n] where n is the number of blocks in the problem
- On subsequent calls, the block order remains unchanged (cyclic pattern)

# Example
```julia
rule = CyclicRule()
updateBlockOrder!(rule, problem, iteration_info)
# rule.blocksToUpdate now contains [1, 2, 3, ..., n]
```
