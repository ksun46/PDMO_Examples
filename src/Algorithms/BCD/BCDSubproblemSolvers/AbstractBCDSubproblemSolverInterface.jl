Initialize the BCD subproblem solver with problem data and algorithm state.

This method is called once before the main BCD iterations begin. It allows solvers
to perform preprocessing, validate problem structure, allocate workspace, and set up
any solver-specific data structures.

**Arguments**
- `solver::AbstractBCDSubproblemSolver`: The solver instance to initialize
- `mbp::MultiblockProblem`: The complete multiblock problem definition
- `param::BCDParam`: Algorithm parameters including tolerances and solver settings
- `info::BCDIterationInfo`: Initial iteration information and solution state

**Required Implementation**
Every concrete BCD subproblem solver MUST implement this method. The implementation
should handle:

1. **Problem Structure Analysis**: Examine the multiblock problem structure
2. **Workspace Allocation**: Pre-allocate any buffers or temporary variables
3. **Preprocessing**: Compute expensive quantities that can be reused
4. **Validation**: Check that the solver can handle the given problem type
5. **Solver Setup**: Initialize any solver-specific parameters or models


**Error Handling**
- Throw descriptive errors for unsupported problem types
- Validate input dimensions and constraints
- Check for required dependencies (e.g., JuMP, optimization solvers)

**Performance Considerations**
- Amortize expensive computations across all iterations
- Pre-allocate all workspace to avoid allocations in solve!
- Cache problem structure information for fast access

Solve the BCD subproblem for a specific block.

This is the core method that every concrete BCD subproblem solver MUST implement.
It solves the optimization subproblem for the specified block while keeping all
other blocks fixed at their current values.

**Mathematical Problem**
The method solves:
```math
\\min_{x_i} f(x_1, ..., x_{i-1}, x_i, x_{i+1}, ..., x_n) + g_i(x_i)
\\text{ subject to } x_i \\in X_i
```

where:
- `f` is the coupling function from `mbp.couplingFunction`
- `g_i` is the block function from `mbp.blockVariables[blockIndex]`
- `X_i` are the constraints from `mbp.blockVariables[blockIndex]`
- Other blocks `x_j` (j â‰  i) are fixed at `info.solution[j]`

**Arguments**
- `solver::AbstractBCDSubproblemSolver`: The solver instance
- `blockIndex::Int64`: Index of the block to update (1-based)
- `mbp::MultiblockProblem`: Complete multiblock problem definition
- `param::BCDParam`: Algorithm parameters and solver settings
- `info::BCDIterationInfo`: Current iteration state and solution

**Required Implementation Behavior**
1. **Extract Current State**: Get current values of all blocks from `info.solution`
2. **Set Up Subproblem**: Formulate the optimization problem for block `blockIndex`
3. **Solve**: Use solver-specific method to find optimal block value
4. **Update Solution**: Store new block value in `info.solution[blockIndex]`
5. **Compute Dual Residual**: Fill `info.buffer` with the dual residual corresponding to this block
6. **Record Metadata**: Update any relevant fields in `info` (timing, iterations, etc.)

**Error Handling**
- Handle numerical instability gracefully
- Provide informative error messages for debugging
- Fall back to previous solution if solve fails critically
- Log warnings for suboptimal convergence

**Performance Requirements**
- Minimize memory allocations during repeated calls
- Reuse pre-allocated workspace from `initialize!`
- Avoid expensive computations that could be cached
- Update solution in-place when possible

**Side Effects**
- MUST update `info.solution[blockIndex]` with the new block value
- MUST fill `info.buffer` with the dual residual corresponding to this block
- MAY update other fields in `info` for tracking/debugging
- SHOULD NOT modify `mbp` or `param`

# Update the solver state based on algorithm progress and current iteration information.

# This method is called periodically during BCD iterations to allow adaptive solvers
# to modify their behavior based on convergence progress, solution quality, or
# performance metrics. Static solvers may implement this as a no-op.

# **Arguments**
# - `solver::AbstractBCDSubproblemSolver`: The solver instance to update
# - `mbp::MultiblockProblem`: The multiblock problem definition (for reference)
# - `param::BCDParam`: Algorithm parameters (may be modified for adaptive behavior)
# - `info::BCDIterationInfo`: Current iteration information including convergence history

# **Optional Implementation**
# This method is optional for concrete solvers. The default behavior is to do nothing,
# which is appropriate for static solvers that don't adapt their behavior.

# **Adaptive Behavior Examples**
# 1. **Step Size Adaptation**: Adjust solver step sizes based on convergence rate
# 2. **Tolerance Adjustment**: Modify solver tolerances based on dual residuals
# 3. **Strategy Switching**: Change solving strategy based on problem characteristics
# 4. **Regularization Updates**: Adjust regularization parameters
# 5. **Workspace Reallocation**: Resize buffers based on observed problem size

# **Example Implementation**
# ```julia
# function update!(solver::AdaptiveBCDSolver, mbp::MultiblockProblem, param::BCDParam, info::BCDIterationInfo)
#     # Adapt step size based on objective progress
#     if length(info.obj) > 10
#         recentProgress = info.obj[end-9] - info.obj[end]
#         if recentProgress > 0.01
#             solver.stepSize = min(solver.stepSize * 1.1, solver.maxStepSize)
#         else
#             solver.stepSize = max(solver.stepSize * 0.9, solver.minStepSize)
#         end
#     end
    
#     # Adjust solver tolerance based on dual residuals
#     if !isempty(info.dresL2)
#         currentDualRes = info.dresL2[end]
#         if currentDualRes < param.dresTolL2 * 10
#             # Tighten solver tolerance as we approach convergence
#             solver.tolerance = min(solver.tolerance, currentDualRes / 100)
#         end
#     end
    
#     # Switch strategies based on solve success rate
#     if length(info.obj) > 20
#         recentFailures = countRecentSolveFailures(info, 20)
#         if recentFailures > 5
#             solver.strategy = :conservative  # Switch to more robust strategy
#         end
#     end
# end
# ```

# **Update Timing**
# - Called after each complete iteration (all blocks updated)
# - May be called more frequently for highly adaptive solvers
# - Should be computationally lightweight to avoid overhead

# **State Modification Guidelines**
# - Modify solver internal state as needed
# - Do NOT modify `mbp` (problem definition should remain constant)
# - May modify `param` for algorithm-level adaptations (use with caution)
# - May read from `info` but avoid modifying historical data

# **Performance Considerations**
# - Keep update operations lightweight (< 1% of solve time)
# - Avoid expensive computations unless they provide significant benefit
# - Consider update frequency vs. adaptation benefit trade-offs
# - Cache computations when possible
